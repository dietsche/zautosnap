ZAutoSnap Readme - Copyright (C) 2011 Greg Dietsche <greg@gregd.org>

OVERVIEW:
	ZAutoSnap is a simple script that is meant to be used with cron
	to take recursive snapshots of a zfs file system. All snapshots
	have the time they were taken built into their name, so it is easy
	to determine when the snapshot was taken.

	Usage: zautosnap.sh zfsFileSystem SnapShotType [MaxSnapsToKeep]

	zfsFileSystem
		The file system that will be snapshotted.

	SnapShotLabel
		Chose a label for the snapshot (e.g. Daily)
		This can be whatever you want it to be so long as it
		is a single word.

	MaxSnapsToKeep (optional parameter)
		A number between 0 and infinity (or 42... Whichever comes first)

		When this is NOT set, an unlimited number of snapshots will
		be kept.

		If you set this to zero, all snapshots matching SnapShotLabel
		will be deleted.

		Otherwise, MaxSnapsToKeep will make sure that only the
		specified number of snapshots will be kept.

SAMPLE CRONTAB:
0 0 * * * zautosnap tank DAILY 30
0 0 1 * * zautosnap tank MONTHLY 3

SAMPLE SNAPSHOT:
When you run `zfs list -t snapshot` you'll see snapshots like this:
	tank/iso@ZAutoSnap_DAILY_2011-11-11_01:15:03

EXAMPLES:
	zautosnap tank DAILY 0	#Remove all 'DAILY' snapshots from tank
	zautosnap tank DAILY 30	#keep up to 30 'DAILY' snapshots
	zautosnap tank DAILY	#keep unlimited 'DAILY' snapshots
